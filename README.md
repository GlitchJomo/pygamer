Arduboy games for Adafruitâ€™s Pygamer and Pybadge

This is a compilation of modified Arduboy games for the Pygamer (and I believe they should work on Pybadges too).
I did not make any of these games, nor did I get approval from the original authors, so please take some time to check out the originals:
